        <p className="text-lg">
          I&apos;m a self-taught web developer based from the Philippines. I am
          fascinated by things that give me focus and one of those things I
          encountered during the covid pandemic era was the tech. It made me
          realize that I was always fond of how things work behind the scenes.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Experience in the music industry was great and it&apos;ll be more
          enjoyable when I gather other experiences in my life journey. I&apos;m
          also a gamer and a babysitter for my niece. Both of this help me just
          focus on the simple things and to make me reflect that personally, to
          take things step by step and feel the bliss naturally.
        </p>
        <p>
          And also you may call my name instead as &apos;<span>Kurky</span>{" "}
          &apos;. Why? Most coworkers, friends and acquaintances rarely call me
          &apos;Kurk&apos;. I&apos;ve asked and what I could summarize is that
          &apos;It just fits your personality&apos;.
